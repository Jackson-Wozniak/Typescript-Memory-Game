# Typescript-Memory-Game

A web-based game written in Typescript that tests visual memory by lighting up a grid of 49 numbers
and keep tracking of whether the user is able to guess the buttons that light up correctly.
The game ends when the user reaches level 15, or gets a total of 10 incorrect guesses
